            <p>I have written this research proposal to study the effect of automobile VUI video training on driver stress level.
              The topic is anything about voice interface in car. There are many prior research
              studying driver performance in terms of error rate and lateral deviation.
            </p>
            <p>In this study, I am particularly interested in measuring physiological state of driver.
              I used skin conductance level as a proxy to cognitive workload and stress.

            <h1>Effects of voice-interface training on driver cognitive workload in simulated driving
            </h1>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In recent years, the use of voice-based technology in cars has gained popularity as more drivers adopt voice control (VC) to help navigation while driving. In-car VC does not only offer multi-modal navigation ability but also enriches the driving experience by providing wider range of entertainment options (Luger and Sellen, 2016, Strayer et al., 2014). With the increasingly capable VC in car(Strayer et al., 2014), drivers might be encouraged to perform more secondary tasks than driving. Therefore, it is important to recognize VC potential threats to drivers, thereby on-road safety.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Impact of in-car systems on driving performance has been a focus in the research community. Previous research (Reimer et al, 2013, Jensen et al., 2010) consistently showed VC reduced visual interference compared to visual-based systems and induced less driving errors (Liang and Lee, 2010). The above might hint to us the benefits of VC due to reduced visual demand. Nevertheless, cognitive interference from VC system could still impair driving ability, and it remained underexplored in research. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Meanwhile, studies on VC showed users lacked or had poor mental models of how VC systems work, partially reinforced by the unuseful feedback from VC system (Luger and Sellen, 2016). Even after trial-and-error practice, users still faced obstacles to achieve tasks, thereby spending significant time to alter commands that could achieve their goals (Luna-Garcia et al, 2018). Incorrect use of VC could also distract drivers visually (Reimer et al. 2013). Therefore, it is important that drivers use VC with a better mental model that reduce visual and cognitive interference. Nevertheless, there was a lack of research into how learning to use VC affects driver’s cognitive workload.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Understanding the actual impact of VC on cognitive workload and how VC training might ease driver workload could better inform design of in-car voice systems, help build mental model and reduce cognitive workload in drivers, thus improving driving safety.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to explore the potential benefits of VC training, we propose to measure how VC training impact driver cognitive workload in terms of skin conductance level (SCL), a physiological measure with high correlation to stress and cognitive workload (Schnittker, 2012). We propose a controlled study in driving simulator, logging SCL data as participants perform VC tasks while driving. We expect a decline in SCL after training in both high and low workload conditions, indicating that training could assist driver in using VC while driving.
            </p>

            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Related work in measuring cognitive workload, effect of training methods, and performance and physiological measurement were described, with a focus in the driving domain.
            </p>
            <h3>Assessing cognitive workload without physiological measures
            </h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Miller et al. (2018) studied the effect of VC tasks on cognitive workload and driving performance. 24 participants performed two in-car voice-based tasks while driving. Tasks were divided into audio-only and hybrid (audio-and-visual). The authors measured cognitive workload by response time and miss count in detection response task (DRT). During DRT, participants press button whenever prompted visually or by vibration (Schindhelm and Schmidt, 2015). This experiment measured how secondary tasks impact driver attention and cognitive workload. Yet, no physiological indexes were used. How learning to use VC correctly would impact driver workload was also not studied.
              </p>
            <h3>Assessing training methods on driving behaviour
            </h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
              Reimer et al. (2014) studied how voice-command training methods affect driver behaviour. Actual highway driving with 64 participants were conducted. Participants performed secondary tasks (radio tuning and navigation) by manual and voice control. Workload indexes of self-report, heat rate and SCL were measured. The authors found no significant effects of self- guided v.s. structured training across tasks. However, participants participated in voice calibration stage during driving preparation. This practice potentially improved participants’ mental models of the VC, therefore posing learning effect. In the current study, the learning effect issue is minimised by excluding the calibration stage and having novice VC users as participants.
            </p>
            <h3>Physiological measures in driving experiment
            </h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Healey et al. (2005) collected physiological data under real-world driving tasks from 24 drives. Data suggested SCL and heart rate were most correlated with stress in driving, therefore could measure effect on drivers under different road conditions. This is supported by an on-road study done by Schneegass et al (2013). They compared SCL and skin temperature data. They found SCL was more sensitive to measure stress levels under different levels of demands.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Dang and Tapus (2014) conducted experiments with driving simulator and real-world drone flying to assess how physiological signals relate to cognitive load while driving. Twelve participants drove 20 minutes and performed manual secondary tasks (such as blinking light) under two difficulty levels (controlled by traffic condition). Physiological data was compared to baseline level. The authors concluded SCL relates to ‘novelty of driving task’ while heart rate relates to the number of events undertaken. This research showed driving workload corresponds to shifts in physiological measures. However, this study had limited generalizability that more participants are required in future studies to validate statistical analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>Physiological arousal rather than driving performance
            </h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Lateral deviation as an indicator for driving performance was common in previous studies (Hammond et al., 2018, Salvucci, 2001, Serafin et al., 1993), and it sufficiently indicated interference when visual attention moved from steering to secondary tasks (Santos et al. 2005). These studies researched visual and manual task interference. However, metrics for cognitive demand were underexplored. Furthermore, analysis (Serafin et al. 1993, Simmons et al. 2017) suggested that VC posed smaller effects on lateral deviation than in manual interfaces. Additionally, physiological index were sensitive to changes in workload before the onset of declines in driving performance (Mehler et al. 2009). Therefore, the current study employs physiological measures.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Stressful driving conditions (such as driving under heavy rain) trigger a shift in SCL that it was widely used in driver’s stress level measurements. SCL is a very sensitive measurement compared to other physiological index (Prasolenko et al., 2017). As the effects measured in driving simulator are less conspicuous than those obtained from in-the-wild study (Reimer and Mehler, 2013), the more sensitive SCL is used in this study.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In the following, we first describe the experimental details, and how data should be analysed. We end by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of this study, how it informs future studies, and its implication for design.
            </p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <h3>Participants</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">A gender-balanced group of 60 native English-speaking participants are recruited (sample size referencing Reimer et al., 2014). They are all experienced drivers who have held valid driving licenses for at least two years, regularly drove, but have no prior experience in in-car voice-control system. Participants have no record of driving accident, and are not under medication that may impair driving ability. They receive monetary compensation for taking part in this experiment.
            </p>

            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <h4>Simulator</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">The experiment is conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator DriveSafety DS-600c with 180o field of view that allows realistic peripheral vision together with realistic sounds and vibrations that simulates acceleration and braking. Simulator is equipped with SCL measurement device for data collection. Simulator is compatible with HyperDrive Authoring SuiteTM - a drag- and-drop software for designing road conditions.
            </p>
            <h4>Skin conductance measurement</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Following Solovey et al.(2014) and Mehler et al.(2016) studies on SCL data collection, a MEDAC System/3TM sensors are attached to inner side of participants’ foot sole by medical paper tape. This sensor is a thin surface of electrode that reduce interference compared to other cup-shaped sensors. Foot sole was selected because it has a high recording sensitivity, as well as
                a lower movement frequency compared to hands during steering. SCL data were captured at 250 Hz without the use of conductive gel.
              </p>
            <h4>Training material</h4>
              <p style="text-indent: 40px">The voice-control training materials are videotaped before the experiment. The video includes a driver interacting with the voice systems to perform the three required tasks in the experiment (described in later section). Participants are provided with video training on completing each task most efficiently, for example shorthand that combine multiple verbal instructions into one single command.
              </p>
            <h4>Experimental design and procedure</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
              To examine the effect of VC training on cognitive workload under high and low workload conditions, a 2 (training) x 2 (road types) within-subject experiment is conducted. The effect of training are compared before and after training video being projected on simulator screen. Workload conditions are represented by road types as in Kun et al. (2014) study: highway representing low workload, and city representing high workload.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
              Participants are briefed the overview of study, confirmed eligibility, and signed consent forms. Skin conductance sensors are attached to participants. Participants are given time to adjust seat and mirrors if needed, and familiarise themselves with the simulated driving environment. Participants are given approx. 10 minutes to practice driving on sample routes within the simulator software.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Before the main experiment, participants are informed that they have to perform three interaction tasks with the in-car voice-control system while they drive in two road environments. SCL data are captured at 250Hz along the whole driving period. Baseline SCL are measured in the first trial in which participants drive under relaxing background music with no VC tasks performed (Reimer et al., 2014).
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In the first part of the experiment, participants drive in highway environment. Following the task procedures by Reimer and Mehler (2013), participants are auditorily cued to perform music selection, voice entry of street address and voice dialing tasks in five-minute intervals. Participants then watch training video on simulator screen, which mark the end of the first part. Participants are given time approx. five minutes to rest before the next drive.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
In the second part the experiment, participants drive under city environment. Same as the first part, participants are auditorily cued to perform three VC tasks in five-minute intervals. This two-part experiment takes approximately 40 minutes in total.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">To control for order effects, task sequences are counterbalanced within each participants for the two drives. Road types are counterbalanced with 30 participants starting in highway first, then in city, and vice versa for the remaining 30 participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Data analysis plan</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Data analysis aims to uncover the main effect of VC training on driver (which is the major focus), and of road conditions on drivers, as well as the interaction effect of VC training and road conditions on SCL. Null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference in SCL between before and after VC training. Alternative hypothesis is that SCL after VC training is significantly lower than before training.

            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">H0: μafter = μbefore
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">H1: μafter < μbefore
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Mean SCL data are normalised by calculating percentage change from baseline level. This normalisation can potentially improve statistical significance (Nourbakhsh et al., 2012).
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">There are two levels of each of the two independent variables (VC Training: Before v.s. After, Road Type: Highway v.s. City). As ratio data (percentage change in SCL) is used, non- parametric Friedman test will be adopted (Reimer et al, 2014). χ2 (Chi-square) statistics, degrees of freedom and significance level will be reported.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">As the Friedman test is an omnibus test, post hoc tests will be required if the omnibus test results are significant (p<.05). Separate Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction will be applied to determine where the differences lie (Rupert, 2012).
            </p>


            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">This study shows whether learning voice-control system can ease cognitive workload, thus reducing the negative impact of using VC. One of the strengths is that the dependent variable SCL is more sensitive and fast in response compared to other physiological indexes and driving performance metrics respectively (see literature review). This advantage is important due to the short period of time for each voice-control interaction, as well as the less conspicuous effects induced from a simulator study.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Eriksson et al. (2014) suggested that the design of in-car VC should support training of users, guiding them under interactive tutorials for the functions available so as to minimise workload. Findings from this study could be useful in informing the design of voice-based in-car systems that support learning and mental model building for drivers.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In terms of study design, the improvements of participants in making useful voice commands may be due to the practice gained before video training that the studied effect would not be merely due to the training.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">This research is also limited as only one type of in-car voice system is considered. Participants may find video learning useful in one but not in another system. Voice interfaces evolve rapidly that this study may not be representative of the current in-car VC systems. Future studies can expand the type of VC systems examined. In the future, comparison studies among
systems with different levels of training (such as with incremental auditory guidance, with video guidance) can be conducted to inform VC design practice.
            </p>
